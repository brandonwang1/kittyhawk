# Kittyhawk

Kittyhawk is the automated Kubernetes YAML generator for Penn Labs (replacing Icarus).

To get started, make a repo using the [Kittyhawk template](https://github.com/pennlabs/kittyhawk-template), where you can write your configuration. You can find a list of available classes and sample configurations in the [user guide](./USER_GUIDE.md).
